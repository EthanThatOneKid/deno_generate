# Hello world

This is a simple example of using the `//deno:generate` comment to run commands
embedded in a source file.

First, change directories into this example:

```sh
cd examples/hello-world
```

## Generate the code

To generate your code, see the
[instructions in the root README](../../README.md#usage).

## Run the example

First, make sure you have changed directories into this example,
`examples/hello-world`.

Then run the example:

```sh
deno run --import-map=import_map.json main.ts
```

You should see something similar to the following output:

```
# TODO: Add this stuff
```

## See the other examples

See the other examples in the [`examples` directory](../../).
